# Introduction

This project provides serialization for projects that are written directly against the Kafka Producer 
and Consumer api that leverage the [Converter](https://kafka.apache.org/20/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/Converter.html) 
and [Transformation](https://kafka.apache.org/20/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/transforms/Transformation.html) api
for Kafka Connect. This allows the application developer to delegate the serialization format to the
user during configuration.
